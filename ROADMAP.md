# Roadmap

## Near-term (0–1 month)
- Ship a validated toy analysis pack and demo pipeline.
- Enforce lint/tests/demo in CI.
- Add schema validations for model/yield definitions and systematics targets.

## Mid-term (1–3 months)
- Expand the runtime to parse parametric model formulas used in packs.
- Implement a true coverage test harness (pseudo-data generation + refits).
- Add a data catalog and download scripts with hashes for any real public data.

## Longer-term (3–6 months)
- Add support for pack combinations with correlation models.
- Provide a calibrated surrogate likelihood baseline (with explicit trust regions).
- Introduce a minimal SBI example only if a credible forward model exists.
